           When I left school at 18 I was interested in the tech industry but it became more of a hobby than it did a career path. Over time I realised that working in the tech industry is something that I’d be interested in doing as it’s full of innovation and creativity. I love the grind that comes with coding and I love studying the new languages and libaries that are constantly coming out, I want to improve on my skills and I hope to do this by working on awesome products that myself and others can get really passionate about.
