        <h1>Unicorn Simmulator</h1>

          <p>
            I created a collision based game where a unicorn character must collect as much falling currency as you can in 30 seconds. The styling is very 8Bit, colorful and the game itself is actually rather addictive. I enjoyed this project a lot as I am a big gaming nerd and love the retro gaming theme.

            <!-- <p> [GamesPost]:
              GamesPost is a gaming site where users can recruit players or find substitutes for their tournament team. It works the other way round where a player who might be looking for a team can use GamesPost to find one. For this app I used my own API to list games on my apps index page. I love competitive gaming so this project yet again was a blast for me.</p>

            <p> [HappyCabby]:
              HappyCabby was an app based around helping London black cabbies make more money and use their time more efficiently. We achieved this by using the Google Maps API to show the whole of London and then the Eventful API to plot out the events that the cabbies could target. For this project we worked in a group of 3.

            <p> [Gametastic]:
              Gametastic was my chance to create something that was fun whilst still learning and getting a better understanding of the React.js language. The app allows users to post their favourite games along with some information about that game (Release year, Developers, Designer ect). Users can then comment and rate the certain game. I used the YouTube API to implement videos of the games.
