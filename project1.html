        <h1>Unicorn Simulator</h1>

          <p>
            I created a collision based game where a unicorn character must collect as much falling currency as you can in 30 seconds. The styling is very 8Bit, colorful and the game itself is actually rather addictive. I enjoyed this project a lot as I am a big gaming nerd and love the retro gaming theme.

            <p> [Gametastic]:
              Gametastic was my chance to create something that was fun whilst still learning and getting a better understanding of the React.js language. The app allows users to post their favourite games along with some information about that game (Release year, Developers, Designer ect). Users can then comment and rate the certain game. I used the YouTube API to implement videos of the games.
